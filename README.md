# KindleColor

## Description 
The aim of this short python script is that of providing an enhancement on the user experience while reading on a Kindle, Kobo, or any other ebook reader without coloured screen technology. In order to provide this improvement, a series of qr codes are automatically generated for every picture and this one is uploaded into a server. Through this mechanism whenever the user encounters with an image, an option (resembling the structure of a footnote) is provided so as to acomplish the aforementioned result.
