# KindleColor

## Description 
The aim of this short python script is that of providing an enhancement on the user experience while reading on a Kindle, Kobo, or any other ebook reader without coloured screen technology. In order to provide this improvement, a series of qr codes are automatically generated for every picture and this one is uploaded into a server. Through this mechanism whenever the user encounters with an image, an option (resembling the structure of a footnote) is provided so as to acomplish the aforementioned result.

## Usage
In order to be capable of using this script one may need a domain in where to upload the coloured pictures. This alongside with the parameters of the ssh connection have to be specified within the lines of the file. But please note the possiblity of the script not working with certain book compressions.
